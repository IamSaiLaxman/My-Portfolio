# My-Portfolio
I'm passionate about using data science and machine learning to uncover hidden patterns in cybersecurity and tech data.
Here, you'll find projects that mix real-world datasets, Python analysis, machine learning models, and strong data storytelling.
Currently exploring predictive modeling, risk analysis, and threat intelligence using tools like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn.
Always learning, always building. ðŸš€
Let's secure the future â€” with data!
